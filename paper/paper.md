## Step 1: Machine Learning: Supervised Learning

We have noisy observations associated with a deterministic dynamical system and we are interested in best fitting, in some sense, these high-dimensional observations with a target scalar observation, related to the same system.

See [@nateghi2022] and [@Champion_2019] for additional context. 

Well, actually I think this wrong, because 1+1=2.

## Step 2: Convex Optimization

The estimated targets are part of a pipeline sending them to a convex optimizer which returns a fitness different from your fitness. You cannot modify the convex optimizer.

See [@cvxpy] for additional context.

## Step 3 Convex Optimizer-in-the-loop backpropagation

You can use backpropagation to train your model against the post-optimizer fitness.

See [@cvxpylayer] for additional context.

## Bonus Problem

Award for this problem: 1M dollars. Good luck.
